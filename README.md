# AI Chat Extension

The AI Chat Extension is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to have a conversational interface with OpenAI's language model, GPT-3. You can enter prompts or questions, and the extension will use the OpenAI API to generate responses and display them within the VS Code interface.

## Features

- Seamless integration with Visual Studio Code
- Conversational interface for interacting with GPT-3
- Responsive design for optimal viewing experience
- Customizable API key and model settings

## Getting Started

1. Install the AI Chat Extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
2. After installation, you will find the extension icon in the Activity Bar on the left side of the VS Code interface.
3. Click on the extension icon to open the AI Chat view.
4. Enter your OpenAI API key in the provided input field.
5. Type your prompt or question in the text area and click the "Send" button.
6. The response from GPT-3 will be displayed in the chat section.

## Configuration

The AI Chat Extension can be configured by modifying the following settings:

- `aiChat.apiKey`: Your OpenAI API key. This setting is required for the extension to work.
- `aiChat.model` (optional): The name of the GPT-3 model to use. Default is `"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct"`.
- `aiChat.maxTokens` (optional): The maximum number of tokens (words or word pieces) to generate in the response. Default is `100`.
- `aiChat.temperature` (optional): Controls the randomness of the generated text. Higher values (between 0 and 1) make the output more random, while lower values make it more focused and deterministic. Default is `0.7`.
